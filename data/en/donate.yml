title: Donations and Gadgets
introduction: Economical contribution is fundamental to the Parrot Project, as the number of servers needed to keep the infrastructure operational is constantly growing and is something our Core Developers could not afford without the generous assistance of our community.  Together we can continue to do the work that needs to be done!
