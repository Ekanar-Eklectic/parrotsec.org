It is with immense sadness and regret that we announce that our community contributor and dear friend Nico Paul has passed away a few days ago.

Nico has always been an integral part of our project and he always put his heart into everything he did.

He will never be forgotten and he will always be alive in our hearts and in our project, which he cared so much about.

We cling to his family and loved ones in this terrible time of pain.
Rest in peace Nico, may the earth be mild to you.
